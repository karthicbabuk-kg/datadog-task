Imports and Initial State:

I import necessary modules from React and my CSS file.
I define the initial state using the useState hook. monitors state stores an array of monitor objects, and formData state stores the data entered in the form.

createMonitor Function:

This function is triggered when the form is submitted.
It prevents the default form submission behavior.
Simulating an API call delay using setTimeout.
Inside the timeout, I create a new monitor object using the form data and a random ID.
I update the monitors state by adding the new monitor to the existing array.
I clear the form fields by resetting the formData state.
handleInputChange Function:

This function is triggered when any input field in the form changes.
It updates the corresponding field in the formData state with the new value entered by the user.

Rendering:

The App component renders a table to display the monitor data.
I map through the monitors array and render each monitor's details in a table row.
Below the table, I render a button to create a new monitor and a form for users to input monitor details.
Each input field in the form is controlled by its corresponding value in the formData state.
When the form is submitted, it triggers the createMonitor function.

Environment Variables (.env file):

The .env file is used to store environment variables.
I've utilized .env in a previous version of the code where DataDog API URL was stored as an environment variable (REACT_APP_DATADOG_API_URL).

Overall, this project simulates the process of creating monitors in DataDog (or any other monitoring tool) by allowing users to input monitor details via a form, which are then displayed in a table after submission. The .env file can be used to store sensitive data or configuration variables.
