Imports: The code imports necessary modules from React.

API Key: It defines a constant apiKey that holds your Datadog API key. This key is used for authentication when making API requests to Datadog.

State Hooks: State hooks like useState and useEffect are utilized to manage component state and perform side effects respectively.

State Initialization: State variables are initialized to hold monitor data fetched from Datadog API and form data for creating new monitors.

Fetch Monitors: An effect hook (useEffect) is used to fetch monitors from the Datadog API when the component mounts. The fetched data is stored in the monitors state variable.

Form Handling Functions: Functions for handling form input changes (handleInputChange) and form submission (handleSubmit) are defined. These functions update the form data state (formData) accordingly.

Monitor Table: A table is rendered to display the fetched monitor data. Each row represents a monitor and displays its name, message, type, and query.

Create Monitor Button: A button is provided to trigger the display of the form for creating a new monitor.

Create Monitor Form: A form is rendered with input fields for message, name, query, and type. This form allows users to create new monitors in Datadog.

Event Handlers: Event handlers are attached to form inputs and submission button to update the form data state and trigger the monitor creation process.

Monitor Creation: When the form is submitted, a POST request is sent to the Datadog API to create a new monitor using the provided form data. Upon successful creation, the newly created monitor is appended to the existing monitor list displayed in the table.

Render JSX: Finally, JSX elements are rendered to display the UI components including the monitor table, create monitor button, and create monitor form.
